# SpringShellTest

This is a very simple and workable sample for Spring Shell 2.0M2.

## How to build?
```
> gradle build
```
It will create distributions in build/distributions, and there will be a jar in build/libs

## How to run?

```
> java -jar SpringShellTest-1.0.jar
...
shell:>print-hello-world jonathan
Hello World, jonathan
```

Enjoy it.
